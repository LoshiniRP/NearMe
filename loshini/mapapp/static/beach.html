        <p>
            <font size="5">Marina Beach, or simply the Marina, is a natural urban beach in 
                Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, along the Bay of Bengal. The beach runs from 
                near Fort St. George in the north to Foreshore Estate in the south, a 
                distance of 6.0 km (3.7 mi), making it the second longest urban beach in 
                the world, after Cox's Bazar Beach. The Marina is a primarily sandy beach, 
                with an average width of 300 m (980 ft) and the width at the widest stretch 
                is 437 m (1,434 ft). Bathing and swimming at the Marina are legally 
                prohibited because of the dangers, as the undercurrent is very turbulent. 
                It is one of the most crowded beaches in the country and attracts about 
                30,000 visitors a day during weekdays and 50,000 visitors a day during the 
                weekends and on holidays. During summer months, about 15,000 to 20,000 
                people visit the beach daily.</font>
