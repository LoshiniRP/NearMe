        <p>
            <font size="5">Vadapalani Andavar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Muruga. 
                It is located in Vadapalani, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. It was renovated in the 
                1920s and a Rajagopuram was built during that time. The temple has grown in 
                popularity, which is believed to be in part due to the patronage of cinema 
                stars. The temple is built on the traditional lines of south Indian temples. 
                The Rajagopuram at the entrance has several stuccos with the legends of the 
                Skanda Purana depicted on them. The Moolavar (main deity) resembles the 
                Palani temple idol and is in standing position. The belief is very strong 
                here that people who cannot undertake the pilgrimage to the Palani temple 
                can visit the Vadapalani temple with their offerings. Palaniandavar showers 
                devotees with his blessings just the same as in Southern Palani. His grace 
                resolves all issues for devotees, and they believe in the power of this 
                sacred temple.</font>
